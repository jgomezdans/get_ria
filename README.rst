Description
--------------

This is a simple script that downloads data from the RIA and RAIF
networks maintained by the Junta de Andaluc√≠a. It uses python as its
main language, and only requires numpy and matplotlib (which in all
likelihood you will have already installed). 

Output files are saved as CSVs.
